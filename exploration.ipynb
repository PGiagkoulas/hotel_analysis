    "# 1. Data discovery\n",
    "First step was the manual inspection of the data. This showed the following:\n",
    "- columns in both data sources seemingly have missing values (empty).\n",
    "- empty values in *hotel_information* can potentially be in two forms: empty strings or value of `-1`, specifically for the `review_score`.\n",
    "    - empty values can be treated as missing for now, pending further potential investigation with experts/stakeholders\n",
    "    - value of `-1` in the `review_score` could also have different interpretation than a missing value, since both are present in the column. Again, this is pending further investigation with experts/stakeholders, but a reasonable assumptions could be:\n",
    "        - hotel has not been reviewed **yet**. This is lightly supported by the fact that the `stars` column is empty for all of these hotels, although the opposite is not true, i.e. all empty `stars` values do not correspond to `review_score == -1`.\n",
    "        - review score is not present at the source (therefore not exactly missing but not present) - this is less likely. \n",
    "- empty values in *pricing_data* show a clear pattern: when the hotel is sold out (`is_sold_out == True`), all columns but `our_hotel_id`, `arrival_date`, `lead_time` are empty.\n",
    "- empty values in this case can have a different interpretation than simply missing values. The data is scraped/sourced from rental sites and when there is no availability, it is to be expected that information pertaining to an \"available room\" would not be present. Thus, no available room, means no corresponding information is available. It is crucial to keep this in mind, so an not to treat these cases as simple missing values and proceed to, for example, impute them.\n",
